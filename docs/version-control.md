# Version Control & Branching Strategies
This page explains how version control helps manage documentation updates.

## Git & Version Control
- Git tracks changes and maintains history.
- Each update is stored as a commit, allowing easy rollbacks.

## Branching Strategy
- **Main branch**: Stable and production-ready documentation.
- **Feature branches**: Used for new updates before merging.
- **gh-pages branch**: Used for live deployment.

## Free Hosting
- GitHub Pages provides free hosting for documentation.
- Supports Markdown and Jekyll for easy site management.
